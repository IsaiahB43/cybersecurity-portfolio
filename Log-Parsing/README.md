# ðŸ“„ Log Parsing with Python

This folder contains a Python script that parses simulated log files to detect failed login attempts, suspicious IP addresses, and possible brute-force activity. Log parsing is a crucial part of intrusion detection and cybersecurity monitoring.

The script reads a sample log file, filters specific types of events, and outputs useful summaries for security review.
