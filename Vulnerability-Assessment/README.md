# üîç Vulnerability Assessment Report

This folder contains a mock vulnerability assessment report created as part of my cybersecurity training. The report outlines the process of identifying potential security risks in a small business network.

The assessment includes:
- Network asset inventory
- Common vulnerabilities (CVEs) discovered
- Risk ratings
- Mitigation recommendations
- Tools used (e.g., Nmap, Nessus, OpenVAS)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è No proprietary systems or client data are used. This is an educational, simulated report.
